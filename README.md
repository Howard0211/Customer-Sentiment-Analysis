# Customer Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Customer Sentiment Analysis Project repository! This project is a collaborative effort between academia and industry, aimed at analyzing customer sentiment from product reviews using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost. The project focuses on extracting actionable insights into customer preferences and sentiment trends across diverse product categories.

## Project Overview

Customer sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding customer perceptions and improving products or services. In collaboration with [Chia-Jung], this project integrates academic rigor with practical applications in the following ways:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Comprehensive gathering and preprocessing of product reviews to prepare for sentiment analysis.
  
- **Model Training**: Implementation of advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for sentiment classification and feature importance analysis.
  
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Deriving meaningful insights into customer sentiment patterns and providing actionable recommendations for enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Key Objectives

- **Academic-Industry Collaboration**: Integrating cutting-edge research methodologies with practical business applications.
  
- **Identifying Influential Features**: Determining key product attributes and service aspects that impact customer sentiment.
  
- **Visualization of Sentiment Trends**: Visualizing sentiment trends across various product categories to identify patterns and insights.
